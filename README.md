# Test Application

This is a mini-application developed with React and Redux that allows users to select options, enter discount codes, generate mock discount codes, and add notes.

# Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine: git clone https://github.com/dennisryanlee/test-app-react.git

2. Navigate to the project directory: cd test-app-react

3. Install dependencies using npm or yarn: npm install or yarn install

# Running the Application

To run the application locally, you can use npm or yarn: npm start or yarn start.
This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser.

# Usage

1. Select an option by clicking on one of the radio buttons labeled "Option A," "Option B," or "Option C."
2. Enter a discount code in the text field labeled "Discount Code." Basic validation ensures that the code follows a simple pattern.
3. Click the "Generate Code" button to simulate discount code generation. The generated code will be displayed to the user.
